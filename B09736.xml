            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>PLACE</hi> of <hi>REFUGE</hi> to Flee to for Safety in a Day of Danger.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>This is a day of Danger and of Fear,</l>
               <l>Hide now I would if that I knew but where.</l>
               <l>Endeavour then I will a Place to find,</l>
               <l>Ready prepared, fitting to my Mind,</l>
               <l>Establisht sure and safe from Storm and Wind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If such a Place I can but get into,</l>
               <l>Sure then no harm the Storms to me can do.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Seek therefore now I will for such a place,</l>
               <l>All Dangers to escape in every Case.</l>
               <l>First then let me enquire if this may be</l>
               <l>Expected on the Land, or on the Sea.</l>
               <l>The Sea is full of dangers, threats and Woe,</l>
               <l>Yea and the Land is likely to be so.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If I should sin as I see others do,</l>
               <l>No Safety surely this would bring me to.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If I should seek great mens Favour to gain,</l>
               <l>Endeavouring thereby Safety to obtain,</l>
               <l>How far might this unto my safety tend?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>O</hi> there are times when they cannot defend!</l>
               <l>Vain is the Help of Man if God do frown:</l>
               <l>Armies have fail'd when God on them hath blown,</l>
               <l>Here's none can save if God will cast us down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Alas, then where shall I find such a Place?</l>
               <l>Look farther yet, and stay a little space.</l>
               <l>On this Occasion then I call'd to mind</l>
               <l>Notable things which I in Scripture find.</l>
               <l>Eternal Safety there is to be found</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Alone in God, whose Strength is firm and sound:</l>
               <l>No Imperfection is in him at all;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>David</hi> doth Him his Strength and Fortress call.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> was sav'd by Him, whenas the Flood</l>
               <l>Overthrew Sinners, 'cause they were not good.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When <hi>Sodom</hi> was destroy'd, he saved <hi>Lot:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He will not let his Servants be forgot.</l>
               <l>Even the Lions rage he did restrain,</l>
               <l>Regarding <hi>Daniel,</hi> and he was not slain:</l>
               <l>Ever he doth and will the same remain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Egyptians</hi> which his <hi>Israel</hi> did pursue</l>
               <l>Like Lions, yet he them soon overthrew;</l>
               <l>So that his People safe he brought to shoar;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Egyptians</hi> drown'd, and they saw them no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Famine shall not his People make asham'd;</l>
               <l>On them he looks, tho they sometimes are blam'd.</l>
               <l>Regard he doth their Cryes, and will bestow</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Mercies on them, because his Name they know:</l>
               <l>Every State to them some good shall bring,</l>
               <l>Eternally his Praises they shall sing.</l>
